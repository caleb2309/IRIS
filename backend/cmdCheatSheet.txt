### **CMD CHEATSHEET: `START` VS. NORMAL COMMANDS**

This guide explains when to use the `start` command versus simply typing a command directly in the Windows Command Prompt.

---

#### **1. USE `START` WHEN YOU WANT TO:**

The `start` command is an **internal CMD command** that launches programs, opens files, or initiates processes, often in a new window or as a separate background process. It's ideal for:

* **Opening files with their default application:**
    * `start "" "document.pdf"` (Opens PDF in default PDF viewer)
    * `start "" "image.jpg"` (Opens JPG in default image viewer)
    * `start "" "video.mp4"` (Plays MP4 in default video player)
    * `start "" "C:\Users\YourUser\Reports\ProjectPlan.docx"` (Opens Word document)

* **Launching GUI applications without waiting for them (non-blocking):**
    * `start "" notepad.exe` (Opens Notepad)
    * `start "" mspaint.exe` (Opens MS Paint)
    * `start "" chrome.exe "https://www.google.com"` (Opens Chrome to Google)
    * `start "" "C:\Program Files\AppFolder\MyGUIApp.exe"` (Opens a specific application)

* **Opening new Command Prompt windows:**
    * `start cmd` (Opens a new CMD window)
    * `start "New Window Title" cmd /k "dir"` (Opens new CMD, sets title, runs `dir`, keeps window open)

* **Opening web links (URLs):**
    * `start "" "https://www.openai.com"` (Opens the URL in your default browser)
    * `start "" "mailto:someone@example.com"` (Opens default email client with new message)

* **Running a command and immediately returning control to the current CMD window (running in background):**
    * `start /B my_batch_script.bat` (Runs `my_batch_script.bat` without a new CMD window, but asynchronously)
    * `start /MIN "" notepad.exe` (Launches Notepad minimized)

#### **2. USE NORMAL COMMANDS (DIRECT EXECUTION) WHEN YOU WANT TO:**

Simply type the command directly when it's an **external executable (like `.exe`, `.bat`, `.ps1` for PowerShell scripts) or an internal CMD command** that performs an action *within* the current Command Prompt window. The CMD window will typically wait for these commands to complete before allowing new input.

* **Performing common system operations:**
    * `dir` (Lists directory contents)
    * `cd C:\MyFolder` (Changes directory)
    * `mkdir NewFolder` (Creates a new folder)
    * `copy file.txt new_file.txt` (Copies a file)
    * `del old_file.txt` (Deletes a file)
    * `ipconfig` (Displays network configuration)
    * `ping google.com` (Sends network requests)
    * `echo Hello World` (Prints text to the console)

* **Running console-based utilities or scripts that operate on the command line:**
    * `python my_script.py` (Runs a Python script if Python is in PATH)
    * `node my_app.js` (Runs a Node.js application if Node.js is in PATH)
    * `my_script.bat` (Executes a batch file in the current window)
    * `powershell -Command "Get-Process"` (Runs a PowerShell command)

* **Executing an executable whose output you need in the current console:**
    * `my_cli_tool --version` (Prints version info to current console)
    * `where chrome.exe` (Shows location of `chrome.exe` in current console)

**KEY RULE:**
* **`START` for opening, launching, or backgrounding.**
* **Direct Command for executing *within* the current window, especially for console tools and scripts that yield output back to you.**
